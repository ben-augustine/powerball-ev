      <h2>How is this expected value calculated?</h2>

      <p class="small">
        Expected value (EV) is the sum of the probabilities of outcomes occurring,
        multiplied by the results of those outcomes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>A simple example</h2>

      <p class="small">
        Suppose you roll a four-sided die:
      </p>

      <ul class="small">
        <li>If it lands on <strong>1</strong>, you get <strong>$1</strong></li>
        <li>If it lands on <strong>2 or 3</strong>, you get <strong>$2</strong></li>
        <li>If it lands on <strong>4</strong>, you get <strong>$0</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p class="small">
        Each face has a probability of <strong>0.25</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class="small">
        The expected value of one roll is:
      </p>

      <p class="small" style="margin-left: 1rem;">
        <strong>0.25(1) + 0.50(2) + 0.25(0) = 1.25</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="small">
        So the EV of this game is <strong>$1.25</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class="small">
        Playing this game for <strong>$1</strong> would be mathematically worth it,
        while playing it for <strong>$2</strong> would be mathematically not worth it.
      </p>

      <p class="small muted">
        EV does not predict what will happen on a single play, it just calculates what the payout will be over a large number of plays.
      </p>

      <h2>Applying this to Powerball</h2>

      <p class="small">
        Powerball works the same way, just with many more possible outcomes.
      </p>

      <p class="small">
        The expected value of a Powerball ticket has two components:
      </p>

      <ul class="small">
        <li>Lower-tier prizes</li>
        <li>The jackpot</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Lower-tier prizes</h2>

      <p class="small">
        If you add up the probabilities of all non-jackpot prizes and multiply each
        by its payout, the total expected value of the lower-tier prizes is about:
      </p>

      <p class="small" style="margin-left: 1rem;">
        <strong>$0.40 per ticket</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="small">
        This value:
      </p>

      <ul class="small">
        <li>Does not change with the number of players</li>
        <li>Does not depend on the jackpot size</li>
        <li>Is fixed by the game rules</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>The jackpot</h2>

      <p class="small">
        The jackpot is more complicated because it may be split between multiple winners.
      </p>

      <p class="small">
        To calculate the jackpot EV, we consider:
      </p>

      <ul class="small">
        <li>The probability that you win the jackpot</li>
        <li>The probability that zero, one, two, or more other players also win</li>
        <li>The share of the jackpot you receive in each case</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="small">
        If you win:
      </p>

      <ul class="small">
        <li>As the sole winner, you receive the full cash value</li>
        <li>With one other winner, you receive half</li>
        <li>With two other winners, you receive one-third</li>
        <li>And so on</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="small">
        The number of other jackpot winners is modeled using a standard
        <strong>Poisson approximation</strong>, based on the number of tickets sold.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Cash value and taxes</h2>

      <p class="small">
        All jackpot calculations use the <strong>cash value</strong> only.
        The annuity and the time value of money are not considered.
      </p>

      <p class="small">
        Federal taxes are applied as a single effective rate.
        State tax is not included by default, but can be adjusted in the <a href="calculator.html">calculator.</a>
